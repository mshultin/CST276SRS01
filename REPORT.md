# CST276SRS01

Weather Station Observer

Name: Mark Hultin

Previous Partner Name: AJ

Next Partner Name: Chris 

---
Issues:
The mean results are time dependent.
Using STL containers in DLL files generates ignorable warnings C4251: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/error-messages/compiler-warnings/compiler-warning-level-1-c4251; Using a pointer to a container suppresses the C4251 warnings.
Unable to implement the WeatherStation DLL source code provided by my Previous Partner.

Notes:
Implemented the GoF Observer Pattern.

Implemented the GoF Observer subject in the WeatherStation DLL project.
Documented the DLL API and passed along the 32-bit and 64-bit DLLs, Libs, and Exps to my Next Parnter.
Implemented the GoF Observer viewer in the WeatherViewer project.
