Weather Station Observer

Name: Mark Hultin

Previous Partner Name: AJ

Next Partner Name: Chris

Issues:
Inconsistent behavior from the provided statistical functions. The mean results are dependent on the time between readings.
Using STL containers in DLL files generates ignorable warnings C4251: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/error-messages/compiler-warnings/compiler-warning-level-1-c4251
I found that using a pointer to a container suppresses the C4251 warnings.

Notes:
Implemented the GoF Observer Pattern in the Observer project.

Implemented the GoF Observer subject in the WeatherStation DLL project.
Documented the DLL API and passed along the 32-bit and 64-bit DLLs, Libs, and Exps to Next Parnter.
Implemented the GoF Observer viewer in the WeatherViewer project.
